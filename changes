v2.0.0
created index.ts barrel file in keeping with other packages in library
updated config files to current template files
added interface iSprite, which ImageSprite implements
exported interface from index.ts
changed getCell() method to col(): iSprite, row(): iSprite, which is cleaner and can be chained
didn't test as such a simple implementation
will fix any bugs if they appear when using package

v3.0.0
changed col() method to column()
removed column() and row() methods from iSprite interface
this gives implementing code more options for setting which column and row is selected

v4.0.0
changed get column() back to get col()
added scale property to constructor
updated to latest tsconfig template
changed methods to reflect HTMLCanvas drawImage() method params: sx, sy, swidth, sheight, dwidth, dheight
client code can now set the scale on instantiation to obtain correctly scaled dwidth and dheight

v5.0.0
changed ImageSprite class again
removed scale property as client code may need to adjust width and height of image dynamically
removed dwidth and dheight from iSprite, client will set these independently
bitmap images used in each application will be scaled to required size manually to improve canvas efficiency
browser then only needs to scale the image if a width or height other than default cell width and height is required
