v2.0.0
    created index.ts barrel file in keeping with other packages in library
    updated config files to current template files
    added interface iSprite, which ImageSprite implements
    exported interface from index.ts
    changed getCell() method to col(): iSprite, row(): iSprite, which is cleaner and can be chained
    didn't test as such a simple implementation
    will fix any bugs if they appear when using package

v3.0.0
    changed col() method to column()
    removed column() and row() methods from iSprite interface
        this gives implementing code more options for setting which column and row is selected
