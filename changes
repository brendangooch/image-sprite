v2.0.0
    created index.ts barrel file in keeping with other packages in library
    updated config files to current template files
    added interface iSprite, which ImageSprite implements
    exported interface from index.ts
    changed getCell() method to col(): iSprite, row(): iSprite, which is cleaner and can be chained
    didn't test as such a simple implementation
    will fix any bugs if they appear when using package

v3.0.0
    changed col() method to column()
    removed column() and row() methods from iSprite interface
        this gives implementing code more options for setting which column and row is selected

v4.0.0
    changed get column() back to get col()
    added scale property to constructor
    updated to latest tsconfig template
    changed methods to reflect HTMLCanvas drawImage() method params: sx, sy, swidth, sheight, dwidth, dheight
    client code can now set the scale on instantiation to obtain correctly scaled dwidth and dheight
